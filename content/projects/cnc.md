A mostly-3d-printed CNC machine.

Based on an open source thingiverse design, I built this mostly-3d-printed CNC machine out of:

* About \*2kg\* of 3d printed parts
* Structural steel tubing
* Motors, bearings, and a 3d printer control board

It has a roughly 100cm x 100cm work area, with about 30cm of Z movement.

So far I've used it for plotting using a pen, and routing using a dremel. The accuracy is quite good and it's large and solid although it could use some calibration. I've also toyed with the idea of setting up a 3d printing head and doing large prints with it due to the large build area I'd have available.
