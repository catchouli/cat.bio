An aesthetic ps1-style game inspired by the classic From Software game King's Field. The project is comprised of over 5k lines of rust code, including a custom opengl renderer, and includes shaders that emulate ps1-style rendering, with affine texture mapping, dynamic tesselation, and the typical warping textures that come with it.
