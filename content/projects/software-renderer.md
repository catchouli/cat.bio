I wrote this 3D software renderer when I was in university. I spent a lot of time optimizing it and adding features, and it was by far the fastest one in the class.

It supports hierarchical scenes and animations, and performs well for a software renderer, having been optimised to make use of SSE vector instructions using intrinsics. The code is a bit old and crazy now but I was proud of it at the time.
