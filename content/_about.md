My name is Caitlin and I'm a senior software engineer from the UK. A few of my specialities are:

* Rust, C++, C#, Haskell (but I'm known for being able to use just about any language :P)
* High performance applications such as 3d graphics, geographic information services and data processing
* Docker and microservices architectures

But I've done a ton of other stuff and love figuring out how to use new technologies and build new things.

If you're hiring and think I might fit the bill, see my <a href="/projects">portfolio</a>, <a href="/cv.pdf">see my full CV</a>, or <a href="mailto:cat@cat.bio">contact me</a>!
