<p>I designed this cute hexapod model in Fusion 360 with a view to one day assembling it. Here's a video from the test app I put together to experiment with the kinematics. I chose a hexapod because the kinematics are simple but quite interesting and it seems like it would make for quite a versatile design.</p>
