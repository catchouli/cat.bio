<p>I designed this neat isomorphic keyboard in Fusion 360 and 3D printed the parts. The switches are cherry-like low actuation force 'clear' switches and it's fun to play with. The underside is wired up as a diode matrix and an arduino pro mini is used to sense the pressed keys and act as a USB midi interface.</p>
