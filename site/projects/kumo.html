<p>This is a new project I've just started.</p>
<p>Kumo is a 3d rendering library. The intention is to abstract the underlying rendering API and provide an expressive scenegraph syntax while providing me with a playground to implement 3d algorithms (cloud rendering and forest rendering).</p>
<p>The above image was an initial experiment with rendering a volumetric sphere, with the optical thickness increasing towards the center. A ray is traced through the volume, and then additional rays towards the sun are traced to determine the amount of light that would be scattered towards the viewer from the current optical depth.</p>
<p>I'll update as I make more progress with this project.</p>
