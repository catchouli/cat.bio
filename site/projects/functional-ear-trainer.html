<p>I recently became interested in training my ear but I couldn't find an application that connected to my keyboard through midi, so I quickly threw this one together. It supports any key, notes from a single octave or any octave, playback of multiple notes, and more. It trains you to recognise the scale degrees of notes within a key.</p>
