<p>This volume renderer was made as part of the dissertation I completed for my bachelors degree. It first converts the scene into a sparse voxel octree format, which can then be traversed efficiently for real-time raytracing. The transparency works by sampling iteratively at points through refractive mediums and the volume can even have a heterogeneous refractive index.</p>
